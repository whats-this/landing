  .faq-box#where-is-the-data-stored
    h3 #[a(href='#where-is-the-data-stored') Where is the data stored?]
    p.
      Any uploaded files are currently stored on Exoscale in Switzerland. All
      content must be legal under Switzerland law. We chose Switzerland as our
      file storage location due to the good privacy laws, and because Exoscale
      is a pretty good cloud provider in our opinion.
    p.
      Any shortened URLs using the service are currently stored in AWS S3, as we
      have not yet migrated this over to Switzerland. Any shortened URLs must
      fall inline with the laws in Ohio, U.S. including any federal laws of the
      United States. Additionally, shortened URLs must fall in line with
      #[a(href='https://aws.amazon.com/aup' target='_blank') AWS' Acceptable Use Policy].

  .faq-box#how-do-i-use-this-service
    h3 #[a(href='#how-do-i-use-this-service') How do I use this service?]
    p.
      Once you have an account, you will be given information on how to setup
      your device to use the service as the file hosting platform. In case
      you're wondering, we do support ShareX and Linux/MacOS through
      #[a(href='https://github.com/whats-this/owo.sh' target='_blank') owo.sh].
      Most other Pomf-compatible clients (multipart/formdata) for file uploads
      or Polr-compatible clients for link shortening are supported.

  .faq-box#private-beta
    h3 #[a(href='#private-beta') Private? Beta? I wanna upload NOW!]
    p.
      Currently we aren't accepting new users through a signup form, as we're
      still in beta and are constantly making improvements and updates to our
      infrastructure. We hope to be accepting users through a signup form in the
      future. If you want to try your luck at convincing Dean to give you an
      account over email, be our guest.

  .faq-box#maximum-filesize
    h3 #[a(href='#maximum-filesize') What's the maximum filesize I can upload?]
    p.
      Currently, the maximum filesize that the server will accept is 100MB. This
      limit applies per request, and up to three images can be uploaded in one
      request. This may be changed in the future, but currently we feel that
      this gives users enough room to upload what they want and not cause us to
      have to pay an overly large bill for storage and bandwidth.

  .faq-box#permitted-filetypes
    h3 #[a(href='#permitted-filetypes') What filetypes are allowed?]
    p.
      Previously, we only allowed extensions/mime-types that were in a
      whitelist. Now we allow all filetypes and mime-types. The Content-Type of
      the served content will be set to the Content-Type of the multipart
      field's Content-Type, but defaults to application/octect-stream if not
      supplied. All content is scanned after upload, and every 48 hours. Any
      content that is marked as infected is immediately discarded from storage,
      the cache servers, and in some cases invalidated on our CDN.

  .faq-box#how-to-access-files
    h3 #[a(href='#how-to-access-files') How can I access files that have been uploaded to the service?]
    p.
      Our service serves content from many "vanity" URLs, all over HTTPS. File
      hosting is separated from the link shortener domains. We don't have a
      control panel, yet, but it is planned.

    h4 You can find the file hosting service on:
