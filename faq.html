All
content must be legal under Switzerland law. We chose Switzerland as our
file storage location due to the good privacy laws, and because Exoscale
is a pretty good cloud provider.</p><p>Any shortened URLs using the service are currently stored in AWS S3, as we
have not yet migrated this over to Switzerland. Any shortened URLs must
fall inline with the laws in Ohio, U.S. including any federal laws of the
United States. Additionally, shortened URLs must fall in line with
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup" target="_blank">AWS' Acceptable Use Policy</a>.
</p></div><div class="faq-box" id="how-do-i-use-this-service"><h3><a href="#how-do-i-use-this-service">How do I use this service?</a></h3><p>Once you have an account, you will be given information on how to setup
your device to use the service as the file hosting platform. In case
you're wondering, we do support ShareX and Linux/MacOS through
<a href="https://github.com/whats-this/owo.sh" target="_blank">owo.sh</a>.
Most other Pomf-compatible clients (multipart/formdata) for file uploads
or Polr-compatible clients for link shortening are supported.
</p></div><div class="faq-box" id="private-beta"><h3><a href="#private-beta">Private? Beta? I wanna upload NOW!</a></h3><p>Currently we aren't accepting new users through a signup form, as we're
still in beta and are constantly making improvements and updates to our
infrastructure. We hope to be accepting users through a signup form in the
future. If you want to try your luck at convincing me to give you an
account over email, be my guest.
</p></div><div class="faq-box" id="maximum-filesize"><h3><a href="#maximum-filesize">What's the maximum filesize I can upload?</a></h3><p>Currently, the maximum filesize that the server will accept is 100MB. This
limit applies per request, and up to three images can be uploaded in one
request. This may be changed in the future, but currently we feel that
this gives users enough room to upload what they want and not cause me to
have to pay an overly large bill for storage and bandwidth.
</p></div><div class="faq-box" id="permitted-filetypes"><h3><a href="#permitted-filetypes">What filetypes are allowed?</a></h3><p>Previously, we only allowed extensions/mime-types that were in a
whitelist. Now we allow all filetypes and mime-types. The Content-Type of
the served content will be set to the Content-Type of the multipart
field's Content-Type, but defaults to application/octect-stream if not
supplied. All content is scanned after upload, and every 48 hours. Any
content that is marked as infected is immediately discarded from storage,
the cache servers, and in some cases invalidated on Cloudflare (our CDN).
</p></div><div class="faq-box" id="how-to-access-files"><h3><a href="#how-to-access-files">How can I access files that have been uploaded to the service?</a></h3><p>Our service serves content from many "vanity" URLs, all over HTTPS. File
hosting is separated from the link shortener domains. We don't have a
control panel, yet, but it is planned.
