                <p>Any uploaded files are currently stored on Exoscale in Switzerland. All content must be legal under Switzerland law. We chose Switzerland as our file storage location due to the good privacy laws, and because Exoscale is a pretty good
                    cloud provider.</p>
                <p>Any shortened URLs using the service are currently stored in AWS S3, as we have not yet migrated this over to Switzerland. Any shortened URLs must fall inline with the laws in Ohio, U.S. including any federal laws of the United States.
                    Additionally, shortened URLs must fall in line with
                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup" target="_blank">AWS' Acceptable Use Policy</a>.

                <h3><a href="#how-do-i-use-this-service">How do I use this service?</a></h3>
                <p>Once you have an account, you will be given information on how to setup your device to use the service as the file hosting platform. In case you're wondering, we do support ShareX and Linux/MacOS through
                    <a href="https://github.com/whats-this/owo.sh" target="_blank">owo.sh</a>. Most other Pomf-compatible clients (multipart/formdata) for file uploads or Polr-compatible clients for link shortening are supported.

                <h3><a href="#private-beta">Private? Beta? I wanna upload NOW!</a></h3>
                <p>Currently we aren't accepting new users through a signup form, as we're still in beta and are constantly making improvements and updates to our infrastructure. We hope to be accepting users through a signup form in the future. If you want
                    to try your luck at convincing me to give you an account over email, be my guest.

                <h3><a href="#maximum-filesize">What's the maximum filesize I can upload?</a></h3>
                <p>Currently, the maximum filesize that the server will accept is 100MB. This limit applies per request, and up to three images can be uploaded in one request. This may be changed in the future, but currently we feel that this gives users
                    enough room to upload what they want and not cause me to have to pay an overly large bill for storage and bandwidth.

            <div class="faq-box" id="permitted-filetypes">
                <h3><a href="#permitted-filetypes">What filetypes are allowed?</a></h3>
                <p>Previously, we only allowed extensions/mime-types that were in a whitelist. Now we allow all filetypes and mime-types. The Content-Type of the served content will be set to the Content-Type of the multipart field's Content-Type, but defaults
                    to application/octect-stream if not supplied. All content is scanned after upload, and every 48 hours. Any content that is marked as infected is immediately discarded from storage, the cache servers, and in some cases invalidated on
                    Cloudflare (our CDN).

                <h3><a href="#how-to-access-files">How can I access files that have been uploaded to the service?</a></h3>
                <p>Our service serves content from many "vanity" URLs, all over HTTPS. File hosting is separated from the link shortener domains. We don't have a control panel, yet, but it is planned.
